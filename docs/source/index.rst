MARTi - Metagenomic Analysis in Real Time
=========================================

MARTi is a software package designed for performing real-time analysis of metagenomic samples using nanopore sequencing. If you're not working in real-time, MARTi may still be a quick and easy analysis solution for you. And if you're not using nanopore sequencing, you may still benefit from using MARTi to analyse your data.

You can try out the MARTi browser interface at `http://marti.cyverseuk.org <http://marti.cyverseuk.org>`_. 

MARTi is open source software supplied under an MIT license. See the `GitHub <https://github.com/richardmleggett/MARTi>`_ for more details.
