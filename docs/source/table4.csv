BlastProcess	n/a	Defines the start of a BLAST process
Name	nt	Name of process
Program	megablast	Blast algorithm to use e.g megablast, blastn
Database	/path/to/db	Database (path)name. Note, this should be the same as you would specify to the BLAST command line with the -db parameter i.e. it is typically a prefix, or may point to the FASTQ file that the database was built from.
UseToClassify	n/a	Use BLAST results for classification (can only be set for 1 BLAST process)
TaxaFilter	/path/to/file.txt	Taxa filter file to use with BLAST (e.g. to filter to bacteria/viruses)
MaxE	0.001	Max E value for BLAST
MaxTargetSeqs	100	Maximum number of target sequences for BLAST
RunMeganEvery	n/a	Deprecated.
BlastThreads 	4	Number of threads to use when running BLAST. Note: for SLURM scheduler, MARTi also uses this value for the SLURM --cpus-per-task option.
Memory	16G	For SLURM scheduler, the memory to use per BLAST job. Passed with the SLURM --mem parameter.
Queue	ei-medium	The job submission queue to use. Can be left out and the default queue (see above) will be used. Currently only required for SLURM and equates to the partition name.
Dust	15 64 1 	Dust string to be passed on to all blast commands for this blast process (optional).
Options	 -ungapped	Any additional options to pass to BLAST (multiple options can be separated with spaces)
